# Bring Your Own Data Labs (BYOD)

Bring Your Own Data (BYOD) labs help you build a serverless data pipeline based on your own data. Starting from a sample of your data saved in Amazon S3, you will go through an intensive workshop that focuses on transforming, analysing and visualizing your data.

At the end, you will have a POC on which you can continue to evolve into a more complex data pipeline and deriving more insights. You will be leveraging [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) for the data catalogue and run ETL on the data lake; [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) to query the data lake; and [Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) for data visualization.
 
Required prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of AWS foundational services such as IAM and S3, as well as basic SQL knowledge.
* AWS account with admin privileges.
