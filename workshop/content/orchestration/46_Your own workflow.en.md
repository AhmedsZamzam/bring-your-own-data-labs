## Orchestrate YOUR data pipeline using Workflows

We just walked you through an example, now its time you think about your own workflow case. Which are those jobs that have to run on a recurring/ schedule basis? 
Please note that this was a lineal job, but you can run some jobs in parallel, you can add them in parallel in the pipeline. Another example of dependent jobs are jobs that extracts data from different sources and ingest it into your data lake before kicking off another transformation jobs.

Think about how your workflow will look like, you can ask help to one of the support members from AWS.
