This lab covers a few examples for cleaning, transforming and partitioning your data before putting the final results to your data lake. You may or may not need them depending on your data structure.

The code snippets shared here are examples and may require modification, trial and error for each dataset. It is a good idea to use either your local environment or AWS Glue Development Endpoint to develop and debug your code before deploying to production.
